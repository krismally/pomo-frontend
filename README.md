## Description
The Pomodoro Technique is a time managment system that encourages people to accomplish more in less time by preventing decision fatigue and increasing concentration. Our goal is to customize the classic Pomodoro techniqe by making it more useful by adding user authentication, customized to-do list, tips and tricks, and more.
